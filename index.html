Hi, my name is Hristo.
I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from Yale College in 2021 and I am currently a software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Here are some things I have made:

  <ul class="projects">
    {% for item in site.data.projects %}
    <li>
      <h3><a href="{{ item.link }}" >
        {{ item.name }}
      </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        {{ item.desc }}
      </p>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
